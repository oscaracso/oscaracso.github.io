	<center><div>The project name is “The Lights of Escaping.” It is a story about an FBI investigator by the name of John. John has spent 3 years chasing a crook that carries a mind controlling device that makes citizens commit deranged activities. As John finally finds the suspect, he runs into another issue where he suffers a head injury and faints. As John awakens, he finds himself in unidentified area. As John continues to explore the area, he faces a series obstacles in this area. The end goal of this interactive python game is to escape the area and to try to make sense of what happened. In the development process, we focused on story planning and learning python to program the interactive story. Throughout the development process, there were only a few minor difficulties in the programming. For example, minor difficulties such as missing semicolons in between if statements, missing indents or unnecessary indents, and linking functions correctly to repeat or play a certain part of the story. These minor issues were debugged by testing how the program ran and through instruction. In addition to the experience, this project allowed the opportunity to better understand how python functions and to understand what situations this programming language is best for. In the collaborative aspect, my partner and I planned the story through a rough sketch of a flowchart using lucidcharts. This project was mostly collaborative throughout the planning of the story and the programming of it. We listened to each others ideas and we also researched different functions that allowed the program do what it was intended to do. In the individual aspect of it, we both had separate documents of the project and used different versions of python, however, both projects are closely similar due to the fact that this is a collaborative project to begin with.</div></center>
